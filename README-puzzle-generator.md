# ðŸ§© Blindfold Puzzle Chain Generator

Creates puzzle chains where your answer to one question becomes the key to unlock the next question.

## How It Works

Say you have 3 questions with answers "purple", "four", and "cat".

The script works backwards:
1. Takes your final message and encrypts it with "cat" as the key
2. Takes question 3 + those encrypted shares, encrypts everything with "four"  
3. Takes question 2 + those encrypted shares, encrypts everything with "purple"
4. Question 1 + those encrypted shares become your starting URL

When someone plays:
- Answer "purple" â†’ decrypts to reveal question 2
- Answer "four" â†’ decrypts to reveal question 3  
- Answer "cat" â†’ decrypts to show final message

Wrong answer at any step = gibberish. You have to get them all right in order.

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @nillion/blindfold
```

### 2. Create Your Puzzle Configuration

Create a JSON file (e.g., `my-puzzle.json`):

```json
{
  "nodeCount": 3,
  "keyType": "secret",
  "completionMessage": "ðŸŽ‰ You solved it!",
  "steps": [
    {
      "question": "What color do you get when you mix red and blue?",
      "answer": "purple"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
      "answer": "four"
    },
    {
      "question": "What animal says 'meow'?",
      "answer": "cat"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Generate the Puzzle Chain

```bash
node generatePuzzleChain.js my-puzzle.json output.json
```

### 4. Use the Generated URL

The script outputs a starting URL that you can share:
```
/puzzle?shares=...&question=What%20color...
```

## Configuration Options

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nodeCount` | number | No | Number of nodes for secret sharing (default: 3) |
| `keyType` | string | No | Must be "secret" (default: "secret") |
| `completionMessage` | string | No | Message shown when puzzle is complete |
| `steps` | array | Yes | Array of question/answer pairs |
| `steps[].question` | string | Yes | The question text (max 200 chars) |
| `steps[].answer` | string | Yes | The answer that serves as decryption key (max 50 chars) |

## Example Output

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "nodeCount": 3,
    "totalSteps": 3,
    "generator": "blindfold-puzzle-generator v1.0"
  },
  "startingUrl": "/puzzle?shares=...&question=...",
  "startingQuestion": "What color do you get when you mix red and blue?",
  "completionMessage": "ðŸŽ‰ You solved it!",
  "instructions": {
    "usage": "Visit the startingUrl to begin the puzzle chain",
    "note": "Each correct answer reveals the next step in the chain"
  }
}
```

## What Players See

1. Visit a URL with encrypted puzzle data
2. See a question like "What color do you get when you mix red and blue?"
3. Type "purple" â†’ if correct, reveals the next question
4. Keep going until you reach the end

The data is split across 3 "nodes" so you need all the pieces to decrypt anything.

## Limitations

- Max 5 questions per chain
- Questions: 80 characters max  
- Answers: 20 characters max
- 1-3 nodes only
- Long URLs might break in some browsers

## Security Notes

- You can't skip steps - need the right answer to each question to unlock the next
- Each question uses a different encryption key  
- Getting a later answer doesn't help you with earlier questions
- Wrong answers just give you encrypted garbage

## Example Usage

```bash
# Generate a simple 3-step puzzle
node generatePuzzleChain.js example-puzzle.json my-puzzle-output.json

# The output will show:
# ðŸš€ Starting URL: /puzzle?shares=...&question=...
# ðŸ’¡ Test URL: http://localhost:3000/puzzle?shares=...&question=...
```

## Troubleshooting

**"@nillion/blindfold package not found"**
- Run `npm install @nillion/blindfold`

**"URL is quite long" warning**
- Reduce question length or number of steps
- Consider fewer nodes (reduces share size)

**"Maximum 5 steps allowed"**
- Make shorter questions/answers
- Use fewer nodes  
- Split into multiple chains

**"Step encrypted data too large"**
- Make questions shorter
- Use fewer nodes
